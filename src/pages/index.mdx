## Welcome to the Fielded Text website

Here you will find both an introduction to the Fielded Text standard and the detailed reference which defines the Fielded Text standard.  This site also contains links to components and editors which implement or use the Fielded Text standard.

## What is Fielded Text?

Fielded Text is a proposed standard which provides structure and schema definition to text files which contain tables of values \(for example, CSV files\).  The standard allows the format and structure of the data within the text file to be specified by a Meta file.  This Meta file can then be used to access the data in the file in manner similar to which data is accessed in a database.

Refer to the [Introduction](./introduction/) web page to find out more about Fielded Text.
