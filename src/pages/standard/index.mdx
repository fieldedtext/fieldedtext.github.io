Release 0.9 of the standard is now available.  It covers version 1.1 of the Fielded Text standard.  This draft is comprehensive enough to enable the development of implementations.

It may be helpful to have a Fielded Text editor available while reviewing this standard.  You can then use the editor to get a clearer understanding of the concepts, structure and schema described in this standard.  The Software web page has a list of available Fielded Text editors (including at least one free one).

Any comments or feedback on this documentation/standard are welcome.  Please send your comments to the "Standard" feedback email address shown on the Contact web page.
